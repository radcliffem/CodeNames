Q. Why did you make this game?

A. I wanted to play around with a way to build communication between computers. I might try to expand this so that you can n computers, instead of just 2, at some point. That way each person playing can load up the game on their own phone or whatever.



Q. Aren't there lots of other online versions of CodeNames?

A. Sure. This isn't supposed to be better, just something I thought would be fun to build.

Q. Couldn't you have the codeMaker type in their clues? Then people could play across the world!

A. Sure, you could. You could also eliminate all meaningful human contact from your life entirely, but that doesn't seem like all that much fun.

Q. How did you pick the word lists?

A. Mostly I had my 9-year-old son just shout out words. I wanted a family game that my kids would understand.

Q. My favorite MCU character/place/idea/object is missing!

A. Sorry. Feel free to build your own word lists.
